# Overview

This software came from the want to learn some Java and make a simple software that had a user friendly gui over the terminal. The idea came from the notice of people having a hard time making decisions such as what to eat for dinner or what board game to play. To help this probelm this sotware as made to making the choice when a decision needs to be made but people can't decide.

This software opens a window with text area, buttons, and a text field. It lets a user create a list by typing into a text area then clicking "add choice". the software will choose a random item from that list and display it in a text field when the user clicks the "make a choice" button. This software also allows them to reset the list and go again by clicking "restart".
